        I am a student in the University of Nigeria, Nsukka. I was born and brought up in Lagos, one of the busiest cities in Nigeria but i am quite the shut-in and I'm mostly  with my gadgets(my PC,phone and others)so it might be no wonder i found myself in the tech space. <br>
        As crypto/blockchain enthusiast, frontend developer and UI designer <i>(though not included in my bio as i am still undergoing training)</i> I am constantly learning from the tech space and hoping to utilise them to the fullest. As such i am oppurtuned to be tutored on backend developement under Zuri & ingressive for good for a certificate. I work with a community of developers at my college under BlockchainUNN which is a great community founded by bright students and fellow developers. <br>
        My hobbies include basketball, which I do enjoy despite how rarely I indulge in active and regular play-offs. As one who has found myself drawing from an early I see it as relaxing and a means of creaivity which inturn is put to use in design and user interface as well as an aid to ideas.
